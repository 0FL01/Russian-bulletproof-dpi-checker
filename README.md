# DPI Checkers
🚀 This repository contains checkers that allow you to determine if your “home” ISP has DPI, as well as the specific methods the censor uses for limitations.

## Checkers list
- **RU :: TCP 16-20** => [https://hyperion-cs.github.io/dpi-checkers/ru/tcp-16-20](https://hyperion-cs.github.io/dpi-checkers/ru/tcp-16-20)<br>
Allows to detect TCP 16-20 blocking method in Russia. The tests use publicly available APIs of popular services hosted by providers whose subnets are potentially subject to limitations. The testing process runs right in your browser and the source code is available. VPN should be disabled during the check.<br>
